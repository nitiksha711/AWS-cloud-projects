2. Create a New API Gateway Instance:
   - In the AWS Management Console, go to API Gateway.
   - Create a new API and import the configuration from `api_config.json`.

3. Set up Environment:
   - If the project uses any databases or other services, set them up according to the instructions.

4. Deploy the API:
   - Deploy the API to your desired environment (stage).

5. Testing:
   - Verify that the API is working as expected by making sample API calls.

Additional Notes
- Make sure to replace any environment-specific settings, such as API keys or endpoints.
